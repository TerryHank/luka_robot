# Function Introduction

The hobot_mot package implements Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) function for detecting box tracking and ID assignment.

MOT uses an IOU-based tracking algorithm to track objects based on their spatial information.

The algorithm mainly consists of 3 steps:

1) Prediction: Utilize Kalman filter to predict the position of the trajectory in the current frame;

2) Match: Obtain matching results based on the predicted positions and observed positions;

3) Update: Update the trajectory set according to the matching results.

## Notes

## tros_mot_node

The `tros_mot_node` is a standalone ROS2 node that subscribes to `ai_msgs::msg::PerceptionTargets` messages, runs HobotMot tracking to assign and update track IDs on targets, and publishes a new `ai_msgs::msg::PerceptionTargets` message. This decouples MOT from the detection node, allowing MOT to be used with any detection source.

### Node Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `mot_config_path` | string | `config/iou2_method_param.json` | MOT config file path (relative to package share dir, or absolute path) |
| `sub_topic` | string | `/hobot_dnn_detection` | Input PerceptionTargets topic |
| `pub_topic` | string | `/tros_mot_targets` | Output PerceptionTargets topic |
| `frame_width` | int | 960 | Frame width for MOT processing |
| `frame_height` | int | 544 | Frame height for MOT processing |

### Subscribed Topics

| Topic | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `sub_topic` | `ai_msgs::msg::PerceptionTargets` | Detection results with targets to track |

### Published Topics

| Topic | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `pub_topic` | `ai_msgs::msg::PerceptionTargets` | Tracked results with assigned track IDs |

The output message populates:
- `targets` — tracked targets with `track_id` assigned by MOT, original attributes/points/captures preserved
- `disappeared_targets` — targets that have disappeared (exceeded `vanish_frame_count`), with `track_id` and `type` set

### Example: Tracking Body Detection Boxes

The following example shows how to use `tros_mot_node` to track person body detection boxes from `mono2d_body_detection`:

**Step 1: Launch body detection** (outputs detection results to `/hobot_dnn_detection`)

```bash
ros2 launch mono2d_body_detection mono2d_body_detection.launch.py
```

**Step 2: Launch tros_mot_node** (subscribes to detection results, outputs tracked results)

```bash
ros2 run hobot_mot tros_mot_node --ros-args \
  -p sub_topic:=/hobot_dnn_detection \
  -p pub_topic:=/tros_mot_targets \
  -p mot_config_path:=config/iou2_method_param.json \
  -p frame_width:=960 \
  -p frame_height:=544
```

**Step 3: Monitor tracked results**

```bash
# View tracked targets with assigned IDs
ros2 topic echo /tros_mot_targets

# Check topic info
ros2 topic info /tros_mot_targets
```

**Example output message:**

```
header:
  stamp: ...
  frame_id: "default"
targets:
  - type: "person"
    track_id: 1
    rois:
      - type: "body"
        rect: {x_offset: 100, y_offset: 50, width: 80, height: 200}
    attributes:
      - type: "height_cm"
        value: 170.0
  - type: "person"
    track_id: 2
    rois:
      - type: "body"
        rect: {x_offset: 400, y_offset: 60, width: 75, height: 190}
disappeared_targets:
  - type: "person"
    track_id: 0
```

Each target's `track_id` is assigned by the MOT tracker and remains consistent across frames for the same person. When a tracked person disappears beyond the configured `vanish_frame_count`, it appears in `disappeared_targets`.

# User Guide

## Package Description

The hobot_mot package is compiled into a library, and users can directly use the interfaces of hobot_mot package in the algorithm detection package to implement the MOT (Multiple Object Tracking) function.

The configurations required for MOT are specified in the configuration files, including four types of configurations:

iou2_method_param.json: Target tracking strategy based on simple matching using IOU, used for MOT configuration in human body, head, and face detection boxes.

iou2_euclid_method_param.json: Target tracking strategy based on IOU Euclidean distance, used for MOT configuration in hand detection boxes.

iou_method_param.json: Target tracking strategy based on IOU Hungarian matching, **currently not supported**.

reid_method_param.json: Target tracking strategy based on human feature, **currently not supported**.

**Usage of hobot_mot**

1. Select the configuration file based on the type of detection boxes to be tracked.
2. Create a HobotMot object using the configuration file.
3. Use the DoProcess interface of the created HobotMot object to process the detection box results, timestamps, image resolutions corresponding to detection boxes, etc., for each frame, and output the tracked detection boxes (assigned IDs) and the list of disappeared IDs.

## Notes

When using HobotMot, it is necessary to ensure the temporal order of the data input to the DoProcess interface. It is recommended to sort the output of the algorithm model in the detection package before outputting/using it.

To ensure the effectiveness of MOT, if the confidence score of an input detection box is lower than the threshold (min_score in the configuration file), this detection box will be filtered out. The state of the corresponding tracked detection box will be set to INVALID, indicating that this detection box is not usable and should be discarded.

Users can adjust the detection box score threshold min_score in the configuration file based on actual usage scenarios.
