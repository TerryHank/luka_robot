# Component Release to Hub PR Automation Design

## Status

Architecture approved in chat on 2026-08-31 and amended by the final-review ledger ruling on 2026-09-01. The split-credential model below is binding.

## Goal

When one of the four product-source repositories publishes a formal GitHub Release, automatically create or update one reviewable Hub pull request that pins that component to the released tag, synchronizes its mirrored content, and regenerates Hub artifacts. The bot never merges a pull request or publishes a Hub release by itself.

The four sources are:

- `D-Robotics/bsp-skills`
- `D-Robotics/rdk-device-skills`
- `D-Robotics/oe-skills-x5`
- `D-Robotics/oe-skills-s`

## Governing decisions

1. A source update is eligible only when its GitHub Release is published, non-draft, non-prerelease, and tagged with a stable semantic version such as `v1.0.1`.
2. Cross-repository dispatch, component proposal publication, and Hub release publication use three isolated Hub-only Apps. The component proposal App has `Contents: write` plus `Pull requests: write`; the Release App has only `Contents: write`, and its ID/private key exist only on the protected `release` Environment.
3. Each component has at most one open bot-managed Hub pull request. A newer release for that component updates the existing PR instead of opening another one.
4. Different components always use independent PRs; releases are never automatically batched.
5. A maintainer approval plus the Hub's required CI checks and last-push approval permits GitHub Auto-merge. GitHub `Contents: write` includes the merge API, and `Pull requests: write` permits submitting reviews, so permission labels alone do not enforce this separation. The workflows and policy never invoke review, approval, merge, or Auto-merge APIs, neither content-writing App is a branch-ruleset bypass actor, and protected `main` enforces the human gates.
6. The Hub is released separately and only by a maintainer-triggered workflow after one or more component PRs have merged.
7. Published Git tags are immutable. A correction is a new patch release, never a force-moved tag.

## Architecture

### 1. Source notification workflows

Each source repository receives `.github/workflows/notify-hub-release.yml`.

Trigger (the recovery input remains on the source default branch):

```yaml
on:
  release:
    types: [published]
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      tag:
        description: Historical stable Release tag
        required: true
        type: string
```

The workflow obtains a short-lived token from the Hub-only dispatcher App, scoped to the exact Hub repository with `Actions: write`, and calls the Hub `component-upgrade.yml` `workflow_dispatch` endpoint on `main`.

Payload contract:

```json
{
  "ref": "main",
  "inputs": {
    "schema_version": "1",
    "source_repo": "D-Robotics/bsp-skills",
    "tag": "v1.0.1",
    "release_url": "https://github.com/D-Robotics/bsp-skills/releases/tag/v1.0.1",
    "target_sha": "<40-character commit SHA>",
    "published_at": "2026-08-31T00:00:00Z",
    "dry_run": "false"
  }
}
```

The source workflow emits no event for an invalid tag, draft, or prerelease. It logs only non-secret identifiers.

Automatic source notification remains `release.published`. For a historical source Release, the source default-branch `workflow_dispatch` accepts exactly one required string input, entered as `tag=vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`; it is retained on the source default branch so it can recover a Release whose tag predates the notifier workflow. The caller supplies no Release URL, publication time, target SHA, draft, prerelease, or status facts. The six verified source Release fact fields are exactly `schema_version`, `source_repo`, `tag`, `release_url`, `target_sha`, and `published_at`; `dry_run=false` is a separate Hub dispatch control and is not a source fact. A direct manual non-dry Hub dispatch is forbidden; a maintainer's direct Hub dispatch is dry-run only.

The source recovery workflow uses read-only `github.token` to query its exact Release API. It requires a matching canonical stable tag, nonempty canonical URL, nonempty `published_at`, `draft=false`, and `prerelease=false`; resolves the tag to a 40-character commit SHA; and dispatches the same six verified facts with the exact-Hub `Actions: write` dispatcher App. Recovery never creates, moves, deletes, or edits a source tag or Release. It is safe to repeat: an already-current Hub is a verified no-op with no branch or PR.

Task 8 acceptance requires the historical `v1.0.0` recovery/no-op pilot and repeat/no-duplicate evidence.

### 2. Hub component-upgrade workflow

The Hub adds `.github/workflows/component-upgrade.yml` with:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      schema_version: { required: false, default: '1' }
      source_repo: { required: true }
      tag: { required: true }
      release_url: { required: false }
      target_sha: { required: false }
      published_at: { required: false }
      dry_run: { type: boolean, default: true }
```

Automated non-dry dispatches must have all six verified facts and the configured dispatcher bot actor. A maintainer may dispatch a dry run manually without that actor or write credentials.

Before changing files, the workflow must:

1. Require the expected dispatcher App bot actor for every non-dry `workflow_dispatch`.
2. Validate the payload schema, allowlisted source repository, and stable `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag format.
3. Locate exactly one matching `components.d/*.yml` record.
4. Query the allowlisted public source repository with the job-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN` and prove that the Release exists, is published, is not draft or prerelease, and has the same tag, canonical URL, publication time, and target SHA as the dispatch inputs.
5. Verify that the source tag is annotated and resolve it to the expected commit SHA.
6. Exit successfully without a PR when the component already pins that exact tag and its mirror/catalog is current.

An unprivileged build job then changes only the matched component's `ref`, invokes the shared sync pipeline, regenerates catalogs/plugins/README tables, runs the release and catalog tests, force-stages additive and ignored files, validates a path allowlist, and emits a binary patch plus structured metadata. It receives no repository write credential. A separate publication job applies only that validated artifact to trusted `main`.

Each component uses a stable branch such as `bot/component-upgrade/bsp-skills`. If that branch has an open PR against `main`, the bot updates it to the newest formal release and rewrites its title/body. Otherwise it creates a new branch and PR.

PR title:

```text
chore: upgrade BSP Skills to v1.0.1
```

PR body must include the previous and new tag, canonical source Release URL, dereferenced source SHA, changed mirrored directories, generated artifacts, test commands/results, and a note that a maintainer must choose the eventual Hub version after merge. It receives labels `component-upgrade` and `source:<component-id>`.

### 3. Shared synchronization logic

The current `sync-skills.yml` embeds its synchronization implementation and directly commits to `main`. Implementation extracts the deterministic sync portion into a reusable script or reusable workflow that accepts a component filter and produces machine-readable summaries.

It is called from an exact trusted-`main` candidate in the unprivileged proposal-build job, never directly commits to `main`, and remains responsible for:

- sparse checkout of the pinned source tag;
- mirror updates with stale-file pruning confined to the component catalog directory;
- workspace-pack `setup.sh` overlay;
- catalog and plugin regeneration;
- README table regeneration;
- existing contract, catalog, and plugin tests.

The existing hourly job is replaced by a read-only reconciliation/audit job. It may report drift or invalid component references, but it must not advance a component ref, change a mirror, create a tag, or push `main`.

### 4. Review and merge controls

The broad branch ruleset includes `refs/heads/*` and excludes both `refs/heads/main` and `refs/heads/bot/component-upgrade/*`; its create, update, and delete controls continue on every other matching branch ref. `main` is excluded from the broad restrict-update ruleset so GitHub native Auto-merge can complete after all classic-protection gates pass.

The classic branch protection is authoritative for `main` and enforced for administrators. It requires exactly `DCO Check / dco` and `Verify committed skills catalog / verify`, conversation resolution, and blocks force-pushes and deletions. The latter check runs the full Hub unittest suite plus catalog and plugin validation on the pull-request candidate. The `component-upgrade.yml` `validate` job is a pre-PR dispatch gate, not a PR-required check; any new reviewable head push triggers the last-push approval boundary again.

The component proposal App has no branch-ruleset bypass and no exemption from classic `main` protection. It authors or updates `refs/heads/bot/component-upgrade/*` and the matching PR, and it makes the final head push. `maxma615` reviews the proposal and chooses whether to merge; GitHub native Auto-merge, rather than an App or workflow call, performs the merge after every gate passes. GitHub `Contents: write` includes the merge API, and `Pull requests: write` permits submitting reviews, but the trusted workflows and policy never invoke review, approval, merge, or Auto-merge APIs.

### 5. Hub release workflow

The Hub adds `.github/workflows/release-hub.yml`, triggered only by `workflow_dispatch` and protected by a GitHub Environment such as `release`.

Inputs:

- `version`: semantic version without the `v` prefix;
- `confirm`: exact value `PUBLISH`;
- optional release-note additions.
- `recover_existing_tag`: explicit protected recovery for an exact existing tag that points to the approved candidate and has no GitHub Release.

The workflow:

1. Validates canonical no-leading-zero SemVer, clean `main`, and the destination state. Normal publication requires no tag and no Release; recovery requires an exact existing annotated tag resolving to the approved candidate and no Release.
2. Verifies every component `ref` resolves to a published formal source release; component versions may differ from one another and from the Hub version.
3. Runs the Hub release contracts, artifact generation checks, and clean-clone smoke checks.
4. Generates an English Release body from `.github/RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md`, the component upgrade PRs merged since the prior Hub tag, and the optional approved additions.
5. Carries the validated source evidence across Environment approval, re-fetches every source Release/tag/object fact, and rejects any tuple that changed before the first write.
6. Creates one annotated, immutable Hub tag for normal publication with the validated notes SHA-256 in its message. Recovery preserves the exact existing tag and requires its notes digest to match before and after approval, then creates the GitHub Release titled exactly `RDK Skills v<version>`.
7. Publishes only after the Environment approval and all prior gates succeed. Every job keeps its job-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN` at `contents: read`; after post-approval revalidation, the publish job invokes the token action at a reviewed full commit SHA, mints an exact-repository Release App token, rechecks the approved notes digest, and uses that token only for the tag push and `gh release create --verify-tag` so the CLI cannot synthesize a missing tag.

## Credential and secret model

| Credential | Availability | Capability and purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dispatcher App: `RDK_RELEASE_DISPATCHER_APP_ID` / `RDK_RELEASE_DISPATCHER_PRIVATE_KEY` | Private key in the four source repositories; App installed only on Hub | `Actions: write` on exactly `D-Robotics/rdk-skills`; dispatch `component-upgrade.yml`. No `Contents` or Pull requests write. |
| Component proposal App: `RDK_COMPONENT_PR_BOT_APP_ID` / `RDK_COMPONENT_PR_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY` | Hub only; App installed only on Hub | `Contents: write` plus `Pull requests: write` on exactly `D-Robotics/rdk-skills`; push stable `bot/component-upgrade/*` branches and create/edit their PR metadata. |
| Release App: `RDK_HUB_RELEASE_APP_ID` / `RDK_HUB_RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | Both values only on protected Hub Environment `release`; App installed only on Hub | `Contents: write` on exactly `D-Robotics/rdk-skills`; after approval, mint a short-lived token used only for the annotated-tag push and matching GitHub Release. Sole bypass actor for the all-tag creation ruleset. |
| Job-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Hub workflows | `contents: read` for Hub/source evidence and destination-state queries; never pushes a tag or creates a Release. |

The dispatcher App receives no `Contents: write`. The component proposal App receives no Actions, Issues, or administration permission; the Release App receives no Actions, Pull requests, Issues, or administration permission. Those omissions must not be described as an approval or merge denial: `Pull requests: write` permits submitting reviews, and `Contents: write` includes the merge API. Both private keys are unavailable to all source repositories, and the Release App key exists only behind approval on the protected `release` Environment. Configure `RDK_RELEASE_DISPATCHER_ACTOR` in Hub to the exact dispatcher bot login. Never use a personal access token.

The proposal publication job keeps `GITHUB_TOKEN` at `contents: read`, checks out with `persist-credentials: false`, and mints one short-lived component proposal App token narrowed to the exact Hub repository and exactly `contents: write` plus `pull_requests: write`. It resets `origin` to the public HTTPS Hub URL and supplies Git authorization only to the `git push` invocation through command-scoped `GIT_CONFIG_*` variables; credentials are not embedded in a remote URL or persisted in repository configuration. Repository-role bypasses can also cover write deploy credentials, so such a credential cannot safely enforce the bot-branch boundary and is forbidden in this design.

The component proposal boundary is compensating control, not least privilege at the ref or API-operation level. The bot-branch exclusion is based on its ref pattern, not the caller's identity, so any principal holding `Contents: write` could write that excluded pattern. GitHub `Contents: write` is repository-wide and also covers Release APIs; branch and tag rulesets enforce ref writes, while exact-repository installation, Hub-only secret scope, protected workflow review, and a fixed branch/PR command path reduce the remaining risk. Policy forbids the component proposal App from publishing or editing Releases, but its GitHub permission cannot technically enforce that prohibition. Tag creation remains available only through the Release App's creation-ruleset bypass, and the no-bypass update-and-deletion ruleset keeps existing tags immutable.

The Release App is not a bypass actor for any branch ruleset, and protected `main` rejects its pushes. Its `Contents: write` permission is repository-wide and can create an otherwise unprotected branch, so tag-only workflow commands, exact-repository installation, Environment-only private-key storage, and branch protections are compensating controls rather than a claim that the permission is ref-scoped.

Two active rulesets overlap every Hub tag. The creation ruleset has exactly one `always` bypass actor: the Release App integration. The update-and-deletion ruleset has no bypass actors. Layering permits the Release App to create an approved new tag while preventing every actor, including the Release App, from updating or deleting an existing tag. Because an integration bypass cannot be constrained to a specific Environment, exact-repository App installation plus Environment-only private-key storage is a required compensating boundary.

The component proposal App is not a bypass actor for either tag ruleset. Despite its repository-wide `Contents: write`, tag creation is rejected; only the Release App can create a new tag, and no actor can update or delete one through a bypass.

## Idempotency and failures

- Duplicate release events produce no duplicate PR because the component's stable bot branch and current pinned ref are checked first.
- A newer source release updates the existing open PR; delayed events older than protected `main` or the existing proposal are rejected.
- Simultaneous events use concurrency key `component-upgrade-<component-id>`; different components may run in parallel.
- Validation failure, inaccessible release, missing App permission, tag mismatch, or failed sync/test leaves `main` untouched and opens/updates an issue labeled `component-upgrade-failure` with redacted diagnostics.
- A failed PR CI run remains reviewable but cannot auto-merge. Rerunning the workflow updates the same PR.
- Source releases remain valid even if notification fails; maintainers can manually dry-run the same Hub workflow. Non-dry automation remains actor-bound to the dispatcher App.

## Verification strategy

1. Unit-test payload validation, source-to-component mapping, semver acceptance/rejection, and idempotency decisions.
2. Add contract tests ensuring every `components.d` ref used by an upgrade resolves to an approved source release.
3. Add workflow-level dry-run support that validates a real release without pushing a branch or opening a PR.
4. Test a real non-production source release event against a protected test Hub repository before enabling the App on production repositories.
5. Verify production rollout with one component patch release, one generated PR, maintainer approval, Auto-merge, and a manually initiated Hub patch release. Task 8 also records the historical `v1.0.0` recovery/no-op pilot and repeat/no-duplicate evidence.

## Rollout sequence

1. Register the three Hub-only Apps; configure their exact repository scopes, the broad ruleset's `main` and bot-branch exclusions, the non-bypassing component proposal Integration, the overlapping tag rulesets, secrets/variables, classic `main` branch protection, and Auto-merge. Configure the protected `release` Environment in single-reviewer mode with required designated maintainer approval. When the sole reviewer is also the workflow dispatcher, self-review prevention is disabled; administrator bypass must remain disabled. Restrict deployments to protected `main` only; the protected-main-only deployment rule and Environment-only Release App key are compensating controls for this deliberate tradeoff.
2. Add and test the Hub component-upgrade workflow in dry-run mode.
3. Add the source notification workflow to one pilot repository (BSP Skills).
4. Exercise the event-to-PR path in a non-production repository or with dry-run before enabling real PR writes.
5. Roll out the source workflow to the remaining three source repositories.
6. Replace the existing direct-to-main scheduled sync with the read-only reconciliation job.
7. Add the protected manual Hub release workflow and update `docs/RELEASING.md` to document independent component versions.

## Out of scope

- Automatically publishing a Hub Release after a component PR merges.
- Batching different component releases into one upgrade PR.
- Rewriting any released source or Hub tag.
- Importing untagged source `main` changes into a formal Hub release.

## Single-maintainer policy update (2026-09-24)

The owner selected zero required approvals and disabled last-push approval. Required PR checks and administrator enforcement remain enabled. See docs/RELEASING.md for the current operational policy.
