# Bootloader / miniboot Build

## Purpose

Build the RDK minimal boot firmware (`miniboot.img` / `nand_disk.img`): the image containing the partition table, spl, ddr, bl31, and uboot that runs before the OS. This is the most foundational BSP component — modifying it requires understanding the boot process.

## When to use

Use when:
- The user wants to rebuild the bootloader / miniboot for **RDK X5**
- Explaining what `nand_disk.img` / `miniboot_all.img` are
- The user needs a custom minimal boot firmware

Do not use:
- For X3 — the bootloader build steps for X3 are not documented in the official build README; say so and point to official docs rather than guessing
- For kernel/image builds — sibling skills

## Instructions

1. **Preflight before any build or flash command.** Confirm the X5 board variant, boot medium (SD, eMMC, or NAND), the exact boot-logo or bootloader change, a known-good recovery method, and the location of a backup of the current boot artifact. For an immediate flash or replacement request, stop here: flashing bootloader data is irreversible until the target medium and recovery path are confirmed. Route normal OS-image branding or customization to `bsp-image-build` instead.

2. Prerequisites after the preflight passes: `bsp-source-sync` completed; `source/bootloader` present.

3. Select the board config:
   ```bash
   cd source/bootloader/build
   ./xbuild.sh lunch
   ```
   The lunch menu offers (X5):
   ```
   0. rdk/x5/board_x5_rdk_ubuntu_nand_sdcard_debug_config.mk
   1. rdk/x5/board_x5_rdk_ubuntu_nand_sdcard_release_config.mk
   ```
   `lunch` also accepts a number or the config file name:
   ```bash
   ./xbuild.sh lunch 0
   ./xbuild.sh lunch board_x5_rdk_ubuntu_nand_sdcard_debug_config.mk
   ```

4. Build everything:
   ```bash
   ./xbuild.sh
   ```

5. Verify the outputs under `out/product/`: `nand_disk.img` (the minimal boot image), `uboot.img`, `miniboot_all.img`. Building does not authorize flashing.

6. Note for the user: official releases maintain miniboot — downloadable from `https://archive.d-robotics.cc/downloads/miniboot/` (the `hobot-miniboot` package follows the same versions). Rebuilding is only needed for bootloader customization.

## Safety

- Bootloader bugs brick boards: recommend against rebuilding unless the user explicitly needs it; always remind them official miniboot images exist.
- Never flash or replace locally built bootloader data without user confirmation, the selected board and boot medium, a recovery plan (official miniboot at hand), and a backup of the current artifact.
- Quote the lunch menu verbatim; do not invent configs for boards not listed.
